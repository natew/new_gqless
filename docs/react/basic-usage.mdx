Using GraphQL data within React components is straightforward.

- Updates components when data changes
- Suspends components whilst data is being fetched

## Installation

First install `@gqless/react` into your project's dependencies:

```bash yarn2npm
yarn add @gqless/react
```

## Usage

> NOTE: Class components aren't supported

First, wrap components that are going to use GraphQL data inside `graphql()`:

```jsx
import { graphql } from '@gqless/react';

const Component = graphql(() => <div />);
```

Next, ensure the component is within a Suspense fallback. [See here for more](https://medium.com/@rossbulat/react-lazy-suspense-and-concorrent-react-breakdown-with-examples-2758de98cb1c)

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

// For example, wrap the App component
const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<span>loading...</span>}>
    <Component />
  </Suspense>
);
```

Now simply use data inside the component:

```jsx
import { query } from './gqless';

const Component = graphql(() => <div>{query.hello}</div>);
```

## Examples

Updating the cache when a button is pressed:

```jsx
import { query } from './gqless';
import { graphql } from '@gqless/react';

const App = graphql(() => {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => (query.hello = 'Updates')}></button>
      {query.hello}
    </>
  );
});
```
