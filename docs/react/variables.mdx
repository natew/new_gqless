Though variables aren't required, you should use them whenever you have mutable argument values.

## Usage

`useVariable` follows the same format as `React.useState`. Once created, you can pass the variable to an argument:

```jsx
import { graphql, useVariable } from '@gqless/react';

const Component = graphql(() => {
  const [id, setId] = useVariable('bob');

  return <div>{query.user({ id }).name}</div>;
});
```
