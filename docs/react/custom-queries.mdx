`<Query />` allows you customize the behaviour in which components are combined into queries

## Basic example

Make all selections from `<Component/>`, be fetched as `MyQuery`:

```jsx
import { Query } from '@gqless/react';

const Example = () => (
  <Query value="MyQuery">
    <Component />
  </Query>
);
```

## Split queries

Split selections into two separate queries, `Main` and `Comments`:

```jsx
import { Query } from '@gqless/react'

const Example = () => (
  <>
    <Header />

    <Query name="Main">
      <Video />
      <VideoSuggestions />
    </Query>

    <Query name="Comments">
      <Comments />
    </Query>
  <>
)
```
