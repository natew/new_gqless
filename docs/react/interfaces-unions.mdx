Components are seamlessly rendered multiple times, letting you use conditional flow - as if the values were already fetched.

## Usage

Using abstract types is as simple as comparing with `ofType()`:

```jsx
import { ofType } from '@gqless/react';

const Component = graphql(() => {
  if (ofType(query.user, 'Employee')) {
    return <div>{query.user.employeeId}</div>;
  }

  if (ofType(query.user, 'Student')) {
    return <div>{query.user.studentClass}</div>;
  }

  return null;
});
```

## Why shouldn't I use \_\_typename?

> Unnecessary performance penalties, if there's a lot of possible types _or_ the component is expensive to render.

In order to determine the correct selections, components are rendered multiple times before they suspend.

Calling `ofType` signals the exact types you want, preventing unnecessary renders:

```jsx
graphql(({ abstract }) => {
  console.log(abstract.__typename); // => null, A

  if (ofType(abstract, 'A')) {
    return <div>{abstract.a}</div>;
  }

  return null;
});
```

Comparing `__typename` doesn't signal anything, so the component will render for all possible types:

```jsx
graphql(({ abstract }) => {
  console.log(abstract.__typename); // => null, A, B, C ...

  if (abstract.__typename === 'A') {
    return <div>{abstract.a}</div>;
  }

  return null;
});
```
