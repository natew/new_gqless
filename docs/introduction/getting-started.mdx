This guide will help you create a `gqless` client for a GraphQL endpoint.

## Installation

Install the following dependencies to your project:

```bash yarn2npm
yarn add gqless
yarn add @gqless/cli --dev
```

## Codegen

`gqless` requires information about your schema, which is generated using the CLI.

Create a new file named `gqless.config.json` at the root of your project, with the following contents:

> You can also use the `gqless` key in your package.json, or `gqless.config.{js,ts}`

```json
{
  "url": "http://example.com/graphql",
  "outputDir": "src/graphql"
}
```

Next add a `generate` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate": "gqless generate"
}
```

And then run the script to generate your schema:

```bash yarn2npm
yarn generate
```

A folder will then be created with the following structure:

```bash
src/gqless
├── extensions/ # All your extensions go in this folder
├── generated/ # Ignore this folder
├── client.ts # gqless client is exported from here
└── index.ts
```

## Usage

Ensure that the `fetchQuery` in `src/gqless/client.ts` is correct, modifying it if need be.

You should then be able to use the client ✨

```ts
import { query } from './gqless';

// for example
query.me.name;
```
