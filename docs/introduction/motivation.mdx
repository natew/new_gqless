From previously working on a large GraphQL codebase, the boilerplate involved with shipping new features often slowed me down.

## What

gqless is a fundamentally new approach to a GraphQL client. It makes using your API enjoyable, by _generating queries at runtime_ based upon the data your app consumes.

#### Your app

```jsx
const App = graphql(() => (
  <div>
    Hello {query.me.name}!
    {query.users({ limit: 10 }).map((user) => (
      <User key={user.id} user={user} />
    ))}
  </div>
));
```

#### Generated query

<!--prettier-ignore -->
```graphql
query App {
  me { name }
  users(limit: 10) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Why

I wanted a GraphQL client that lets you _forget you're using GraphQL_.

I also wanted to tackle some issues shared across all existing GraphQL clients:

- **Double declaration of queries**. [babel-blade](https://github.com/sw-yx/babel-blade) uses static analysis to partially solve this, but JS is dynamic by nature

- **Slow Typescript DX**. Typescript should speed up your workflow, not slow it down

- **Inefficient queries**, due to underutilized nesting. [Relay](https://relay.dev) is a solution, but has even more boilerplate ðŸ˜¢

## Workflow comparison

Lets say you've just added a new field to your API, and want it displayed within multiple places in the UI:

```graphql
type User {
  username: String!
+ avatarUrl(size: Int!): String!
}
```

### Conventional client

First you'd need to search your components, and identify which queries need updating. After referring to your browser for documentation, you'd then update the query

```graphql
query UserProfile(avatarSize: Int!) {
  user {
    ...
+   avatarUrl(size: $avatarSize)
  }
}
```

Typically you'd then run a type generator to create types for each query (changes may not be reflected in IDE straight away).

Finally you'd do the task you set out to do - updating the components,

```jsx
const UserProfile = ({ id }) => {
  const { data } = useQuery(USER_PROFILE, {
    variables: { id, avatarSize: 100 },
  });

  return <img src={data.user.avatarUrl} />;
};
```

### Using gqless

Just update the UI, and the queries generated at runtime will reflect your changes.

```jsx
import { graphql } from '@gqless/react';
import { query } from './gqless';

const UserProfile = graphql(({ user }) => {
  return <img src={user.avatarUrl({ size: 100 })} />;
});
```
